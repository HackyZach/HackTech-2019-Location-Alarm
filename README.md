# HackTech-Location-Alarm
A location-based alarm that triggers when a user enters a specified location. This idea was derived from taking the train and bus to CSUF where passengers are often seen sleeping or panic about missing their stop. Bicyclists can use it to pedal hard knowing their alarm will go off at the place they're meeting their bicyclists friends. It can also serve as a reminder to drivers want to pick up something from a store.
